      <p><b>Animation background for header and footer on all pages in the <i>animation.css</i> file </b><br>
        1. The CSS code uses positioning schemes by setting the "position" property to "relative" for the "section" selector. This is a basic positioning scheme. <br>
        For the ".air" class selectors, the "position" property is set to "absolute", which is another positioning scheme. Additionally, the "bottom" and "left" properties are used to specify the position of the elements. <br>
        
        2. The CSS code applies two different CSS3 techniques. For the ".air.air1" selector, an animation named "wave" is applied with a duration of 30s and is set to repeat infinitely. This is an example of the animation CSS3 technique. <br>
        For the ".air.air2", ".air.air3", and ".air.air4" selectors, animations named "wave2" are applied with different durations and delays. This is also an example of the animation CSS3 technique. <br>
        
        3. The styles in the CSS code are grouped into a style sheet. The styles are written in a single file and are not embedded directly into the HTML file. <br>

    <div class="free">
      <p><b>Styling text block wit box-shadow for the About page in the <i>home_page.css</i> file, 1-16 lines </b><br>
        1. The positioning scheme used in this code is "static". This means that the element will be positioned according to the normal flow of the document. <br>
        It will not be affected by any positioning properties applied to it.<br>
        2. The code does not include any CSS3 techniques such as round corners, gradients, transformations, transitions, or animations. <br>
        It only includes basic styles such as background color, padding, margins, width, text alignment, borders, and box shadow.<br>
        3. All the styles in this code are grouped together within the same style rule in the external style sheet for the ".welcome" class. <br>
        This allows all the styles to be applied to any element with the "welcome" class. <br> </p>
    </div>

    <div class="free">
      <p> <b>Styling text block wit box-shadow for the Home page in the <i>home_page.css</i> file, 40-47 lines  </b>  <br>
        1. The positioning scheme used in this code is static. <br>
        2. The "border-radius" property is used to create rounded corners on the element with the id "loc". <br>
        The "box-shadow" property is used to create a light gray shadow around the element. There is scaling image with the use of transition. <br>
        3. The styles in this code are grouped into a style block within a style sheet. <br>
        The styles are applied specifically to the element with the id "loc" using the "#" selector. The "border-radius" and "box-shadow" styles are applied to the element by default. 
        The "transform" and "filter" styles are applied to the element when it is hovered over, because they are specified within the "#loc:hover" selector. <br>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="free">
      <p><b>Two-column layout for the About page in the <i>about.css</i> file, 1-10 lines </b> <br>
        1. The positioning scheme used in this code is the "static" positioning scheme. <br>
        2. The basic techniques are applied using properties like "border", "column-count", "column-width", "column-gap" for the two-column layout <br>
        3. The styles in this code are grouped into an external style sheet. <br>
      </p>

    <div class="free">
      <p><b>Styling buttons and forms for the Apply page in the <i>apply.css</i> file, 37-49, 78-83 lines </b><br>
        1. All the elements have their default positioning scheme which is static. <br>
        2. The code uses basic CSS3 techniques such as setting round corners and making appearance remains unchanged when click. <br>
        3. The styles are grouped into a separate style sheet <br>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="free">
      <p><b>Decoration for the text block for the Visit page in the <i>visit.css</i> file, 4-28 lines </b><br>
        1. This code uses the static positioning scheme for the ".visit_welcome" class. <br>
        2. This code uses two different kinds of CSS3 techniques. It uses basic techniques such as round corner and gradient for the background, <br>
        and also uses transitions when hovering for the ".visit_welcome" class. <br>
        3. The styles in this code are grouped into a single style sheet <br>

    <div class="free">
      <p><b>Decoration for the text block for the Visit page in the <i>visit.css</i> file, 67-75 lines </b><br>
        1. The code uses the positioning scheme of "static" for the "img" element <br>
        2. The code applies the CSS3 technique of "transform" to the "img" element, which allows scaling the image. <br>
        It also uses the CSS3 technique of "transition" to create a smooth transition effect on the "transform" property. <br>
        Finally, it applies the CSS3 technique of "filter" to add a grayscale effect to the image before hovering. <br>
        3. The styles in the code are grouped into a single style sheet <br>

    </div>

    <div class="free">
      <p><b>Video animation for the Program page <i>program.css</i> file, 44-58 lines  </b><br>
        1. The code uses static (none) positioning. <br>
        2. The code uses CSS3 techniques such as transition and animation. The transition property is used to specify the duration and timing function of a property change, <br>
        while the animation property is used to define animations. The animation property in the code applies the "show" animation for 3 seconds with a delay of 1 second. <br>
        The animation-fill-mode property is also used to specify that the animation should apply the styles of the last keyframe after it finishes.

      <p><b>ES6 features: </b> <br>
        1. Apply.js, 1-7 lines -  RankClass is defined as a class because it represents a specific entity with properties (college, major, rank) and a constructor to initialize those properties. Each instance of RankClass represents a major choice with its associated college, major, and rank. It is used to update the chosen-majors-table in the HTML document.<br>
        2. Apply.js, 32-36 line  - the variable "specialNum" is declared as a new Map using the Map constructor function. We need special treatment for some ordinal words, such as first, second, and third.<br>
        3. Apply.js, 13 line - the variable "i" is declared using the let keyword in the for loop because we want to limit the scope of the variable "i" to the for loop block.<br>
        4. Apply.js, 14-15 lines - the variables "col" and "tit" are declared using the const keyword to reference elements because we don't want their values to be re-assigned. <br>
        5. Apply.js, 63-64 lines - the variables "total" and "choices" are declared using let because we want to be able to modify their values later in the code to show the Total Number of Majors Applied, and the variable "choices" in this code is an array that is used to store the input values of the user's choices in ranking majors to later update the table. <br>
        6. Apply.js, 72-79 lines - variables "table", "collegeCell", "majorCell", "rankCell" are declared using const because we don't want to modify already updated information in table. <br>
        7. Program.js, 1-10 lines - Variables "messages", "randomIndex", "randomMessage", "promotionBlock" are defined using const because they are not meant to be reassigned to new values. <br>
        The messages variable is an array of strings that contains different promotional messages. Since this array does not need to be modified, it is defined using const. <br>
        The randomIndex variable is used to store a randomly generated index to access a random message from the messages array. This value does not need to be changed after it is initially assigned, so it is defined using const. <br>
        The randomMessage variable is used to store the randomly selected message from the messages array. This value does not need to be changed after it is initially assigned, so it is defined using const. <br>
        The promotionBlock variable is used to store the HTML element with the ID "randomMessage". This element is not expected to change after it is initially assigned, so it is defined using const.
